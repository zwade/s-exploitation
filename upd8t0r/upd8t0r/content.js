The adobe flash updater is actually written in adobe flash! It was originally written in C but that was too performant.

The first version of the flash updater was rushed through production in order to meet the holiday rush in 1998

Flash was first developed by FutureWave, then Macromedia, then Adobe. However, FutureWave never gave up the rights to the flash updater, and so FutureWave is still in charge of updating flash.

The flash updater requires over 20 gigs of ram to run. If you don't have that much installed, it will download more for you first before it performs its operations`,
